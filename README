Microsoft DirectUI Library
========================================
Disclaimer: All information and source code provided with this document

About
---------------
DirectUI is a C++ user interface library created by Microsoft to be a WPF 
like API for native applications . It is not released to the public but is 
being used widely throughout Microsoft products including Windows, 
Microsoft Office, and Windows Live Messenger. 

Due to the differences and non standardization of current C++ features; 
i.e. Name decoration, and virtual table exports you must use a 
compatible version of the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

Usage
---------------
The library files have been provided for you, in lib/.  They were created with 
dumpbin and lib utilities provided by Microsoft Visual Studio.

Simply include 'directui.h" and get going.

Unfortunately there is currently no documentation, so you need to work in
the dark.

I have a linker error!
---------------
You may experience a few linker errors when using the library.  There are 
currently over 3000 exported functions in dui70.dll and it is almost impossible
for me to ensure that all of them are correctly defined in the include files.

But, you may submit a bug report, or the preferred method is to find the offending
definition and fix it using the demangled name in 'lib/32bit/classes/<class>', then 
please let me know what was defined improperly.
