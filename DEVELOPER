DirectUI Notes for Developers
========================================

Where do you get the lib files?
---------------
We use the MS provided utility called DUMPBIN as follows:
	DUMPBIN /EXPORTS C:\Windows\System32\dui70.dll > dui70_32.txt
to extract the 32 bit exports, and similarily
	DUMPBIN /EXPORTS c:\Windows\SysWOW64\dui70.dll > dui70_64.txt
	
Then we clean up each file, so that it matches the format of a .def file.

But, stdcall functions are not mangled in the exports file, so we must add some
aliases using ordinals from the original DUMPBIN file.

Then once we have dui70.def we create the lib and exp file as follows:
	LIB /DEF:dui70_32.def
and similarily for 64 bit,
	LIB /DEF:dui70_64.def
